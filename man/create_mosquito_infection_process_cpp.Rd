\usage{
create_mosquito_infection_process_cpp(mosquito, human, states, variables)
}
\arguments{
\item{mosquito}{the mosquito individual}

\item{human}{the human individual}

\item{states}{a list of relevant model states (Sm, Pm)}

\item{variables}{a list of relevant model variables (birth, zeta, infectivity, mosquito_variety)}
}
\description{
This is the process of infection for mosquitos. It results in a state
transition from Sm to Pm for infected mosquitos.

NOTE: this process will become obsolete when the model is reformulated to
model individual mosquitos biting individual humans.
