\title{Get model parameters}
\usage{
get_parameters()
}
\description{
get_paramaters creates a named list of parameters for use in the model. These
parameters are passed to process functions. These parameters are explained in
"The US President's Malaria Initiative, Plasmodium falciparum transmission
and mortality: A modelling study."

NOTE: this function is likely to be extended to read in command line / config
file parameters

The parameters are defined below.

fixed state transitions:
\itemize{
\item rd - the rate at which humans move from state D to A
\item ra - the rate at which humans move from state A to U
\item ru - the rate at which humans move from state U to S
\item rel - the rate at which mosquitos move from state E to L
\item rl - the rate at which mosquitos move from state L to P
\item rpl - the rate at which mosquitos move from state P to Sm
\item mup - the rate at which pupal mosquitos die
\item mum - the rate at which developed mosquitos die
}

\itemize{
\item rm - decay rate for maternal immunity to clinical disease
\item rvm - decay rate for maternal immunity to severe disease

\itemize{
\item b0 - maximum probability due to no immunity

\itemize{
\item theta0 - maximum probability due to no immunity
\item theta1 - maximum reduction due to immunity
\item iv0 - scale parameter
\item kv - shape parameter
\item fv0 - age dependent modifier
\item av - age dependent modifier
\item gammav - age dependent modifier
}

immunity reducing probability of detection:
\itemize{
\item fd0 - time-scale at which immunity changes with age
\item ad - scale parameter relating age to immunity
\item gammad - shape parameter relating age to immunity
\item d1 - minimum probability due to immunity
\item dmin - minimum probability due to immunity NOTE: there appears to be a
mistake here!
\item id0 - scale parameter
\item kd - shape parameter
}

immunity boost grace periods:
\itemize{
\item ub - period in which pre-erythrocytic immunity cannot be boosted
\item uc - period in which clinical immunity cannot be boosted
\item uv - period in which severe immunity cannot be boosted
\item ud - period in which immunity to detectability cannot be boosted
}

blood meal rates:
\itemize{
\item av1 - blood meal rate for the first variety of mosquitos
\item av2 - blood meal rate for the second variety of mosquitos
\item av3 - blood meal rate for the third variety of mosquitos
}

infectivity towards mosquitos:
\itemize{
\item cd - infectivity of clinically diseased humans towards mosquitos
\item gamma1- parameter for infectivity of asymptomatic humans

}

unique biting rate:
\itemize{
\item a0 - age dependent biting parameter
\item rho - age dependent biting parameter
\item sigma_squared - heterogeneity parameter
}

miscellaneous:
\itemize{
\item de - delay for infection
\item beta - the average number of eggs laid per female mosquito per day
\item human population - the number of humans to model
\item mosquito limit - the maximum number of mosquitos to allow for in the
