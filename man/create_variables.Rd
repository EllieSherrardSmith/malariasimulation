\description{
create_variables creates the human and mosquito variables and constants for
the model. Variables are used to track real data for each individual over
time, they are read and updated by processes. Constants remain fixed for each
individual over the whole simulation.

The human variables are defined as:
\itemize{
\item age - an integer representing the number of years this individual has been
alive
\item last_bitten - the last timestep at which this individual was bitten, used
for tracking grace periods in the boost of immunity
\item last_infected - the last timestep at which this individual was infected, used
for tracking grace periods in the boost of immunity
\item infection_schedule - the last timestep at which this individual was infected, used
for scheduling state transitions to I
\item asymptomatic_infection_schedule - the last timestep at which this
individual was infected, used for scheduling state transitions to A
\item is_severe - a binary indicator (0 or 1) for if the individual currently has
severe malaria
\item ICM - Maternal immunity to clinical disease
\item IVM - Maternal immunity to severe disease
\item IB  - Pre-erythoctic immunity
\item ICA  - Acquired immunity to clinical disease
\item IVA  - Acquired immunity to severe disease
\item ID - Acquired immunity to detectability
\item xi - Heterogeneity of human individuals
\item variety - The variety of mosquito, either 1, 2 or 3. These are related to
blood meal rate parameters av1, av2 and av3
