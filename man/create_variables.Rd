the model. Variables are used to track real data for each individual over
time, they are read and updated by processes

The human variables are defined as:
\itemize{
\item birth - an integer representing the timestep when this individual was born
\item last_boosted_* - the last timestep at which this individual's immunity was
boosted for tracking grace periods in the boost of immunity
\item is_severe - a binary indicator (0 or 1) for if the individual currently has
severe malaria
\item ICM - Maternal immunity to clinical disease
\item IVM - Maternal immunity to severe disease
\item IB  - Pre-erythoctic immunity
\item ICA  - Acquired immunity to clinical disease
\item IVA  - Acquired immunity to severe disease
\item ID - Acquired immunity to detectability
\item zeta - Heterogeneity of human individuals
\item zeta_group - Discretised heterogeneity of human individuals
\item variety - The variety of mosquito, either 1, 2 or 3. These are related to
blood meal rate parameter
