\arguments{
\item{timesteps, }{the number of timesteps to run the simulation for}
}
\description{
The main entrypoint for the simulation. run_simulation puts together the
model components and runs the malaria simulation. This currently returns a
2D vector (number of humans * timesteps) representing the state of each
human at each timestep of the simulation

Warning: the return type of this function is likely to change as we figure
out what kind of outputs we would like to report from the simulation.
